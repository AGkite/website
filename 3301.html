		<h1><b>cicadianism</b>, what is it?</h1>
		<p><b>cicadanism, is a technomysticism order built around the cicada. 
        they claim to not be a religion nor a science. They say there goals are 
        to achieve enlightenment. They Define enlightenment
		as being fully present and optimized, and to be part of the global conciousness.<br><br>
		Initiates must follow a path comprised of primes to reach the numberless degree of Imago the degrees are:<br>
		5 - neophyte<br>
		3 - magis<br>
		2 - instar<br>
		_ - imago<br><br>
        
		to become an initiate one must first declare him or herself privately as a cicadian. then you must join a brood.<br>
		in <b>liber primus</b> 3301 left so far 4 instructions and they are as follows:<br>
		command your own self<br>

		<b>a koan</b>
		a man decided to go and study with a master<br>
		he went to the door of the master<br>
		"who are you who wishes to study here" asked the master<br>
		the student told the master his name<br>
		"that is not who you are, that is only what you are called.<br>
		who are you who wishes to study here" he asked again<br>
		the man thought for a moment and replied "i am a professor"<br>
		"that is what you do, not who you are" replied the master.
		"who are you who wishes to study here"<br>
		confused, the man thought some more<br>
		finally, he answered, "i am a hman being"<br>
		"that is only only your species, not who you are"<br>
		who are you who wishes to study here" asked the master again<br>
		after a moment of thought, the professor replied "i am a consciousness inhabiting an arbitrary body<br>
		"that is merely what you are, not who you are<br>
		who are you who wishes to study here"<br>
		the man was getting irritated<br>
		"i am" he started<br>
		but he could think of nothing else to say, so he trailed off<br>
		after a long pause the master replied "then you are welcome to come study"<br>
		<b>an instruction</b>
		do four unreasonable things each day<br>
		<b>the loss of divinity</b>
		the circumference practicies three behaviors which cause the loss of divinity<br>
		<b>consumption</b>
		we comsume too much because we believe<br>
		the following twoo errors within the deception<br>
		1. we do not have enough, or there is not enough<br>
		2. we have what we have now by luck; and<br>
		we will not be strong enough later to<br>
		obtain what we need<br>
		most things are not worth consuming<br>
		<b>preservation</b>
		we preserve things because we are weak<br>
		if we lose them we will not be stong enough to gain them again<br>
		this is the deception<br>
		most things are not worth preserving<br>
		<b>adherence</b>
		we follow dogma so that we can belong<br>
		and be right;  or we follow reason so we<br>
		can belong and be right<br>
		there is nothing to be right about;<br>
		to belong is death<br>
		it is the behaviors of consumption,<br>
		preservation, and adherence<br>
		and thus our divinity<br>
		<b>some wisdom</b>
		amass great wealth<br>
		never become attached to what you own<br>
		be prepare to destroy all that you own<br>
		<b>an instruction</b>
		program your mind<br>
		program reality<br>
		<b>a koan</b>
		during a lesson, the master explained the I<br>
		"the i is the voice of the circumference," he said<br>
		when asked by a studen to explain what that mean;<br>
		the master said "it is a voice inside your head<br>
		"i dont have a voice in my head" thought the student<br>
		and he raised his hand to tell the master<br>
		the master stopped the student and said<br>
		"the voice that just said you have no voice in your head is the I"<br>
		and the students were enlightened<br>
		<b>and instruction</b>
		qeustion all things discover truth inside youself<br>
		follow your truth impose nothing on others<br>
		know this<br>

		<b>The truth about Cicada.</b><br>
        <b>User: /u/Cicada3301Dave</b>
        Supposedly cicada 3301 was just a puzzle created by a few 
        creative people at MIT who thought the puzzles were actually
        impossible, but after it got a lot of attention they continued 
        to create more puzzles and monitor them. Though apparently
        people started contacting them personally asking about personal 
        information. i'm not sure if I believe it, but its
        certainly plausible and possible. try contacting the above 
        mentioned reddit user if you want more information.<br><br>

        <h1>who is thomas?</h1>
        Thomas schoenberger is the creator of the latest cicada puzzles, but hes also a bit of a jackass.
        He's ex CIA, a good piano player, and the man behind the sophia musik stuff.
