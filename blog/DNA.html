		<h1>DNA data storage</h1>
		<p>DNA is a possibility, and almost a reality in the real world. 
Scientists have been storing data on strands of DNA since 2012, when 
harvard encoded a 52,000 word book into DNA strands. This was done by 
translating the DNA alphebet (ATGC) into 1s and 0s. Using this method we
 could potentially store the entire internet on only a couple grams of 
DNA. DNA is also great for storage because it can be remarkably durable 
when kept in dry cool conditions. they can work for up to 500 years even
 in harsh conditions. Comparing to things like CDs floppy disks, and 
magnetic tapes which only last 1 to 2 decades. Thats an amazing thing. 
To store the data itself you could either translate the binary to base4 
to support the As and Ts and the Cs and Gs. or you could say ATs equal 0
 and CGs equal 1. and translate the binary to genetic code or vise 
versa.</p>
