		<h1>Dark Fantasy Network...?</h1>
		<p>so what if you aren't familiar with the deep web lore, and spoopy 
stories, you're probably asking just what in the hell is a dark fantasy 
network? well the Dark Fantasy Network is actually apart of a greater 
lore called the marianas web. If you don't know what the marianas web 
is, then youre basically retarded. even a couple normies dwelling the 
realm of clearweb know about it. For you plebians who know not of this 
"marianas web" here's what it is. The marianas web is basically the very
 last "layer" of the web. I put layer in qoutations because the web 
isn't exactly comprised of layers. I mean it is sort of, but there's 
only two, the clearweb, and deepweb.
		the clearweb are sites like google, and bing, and yahoo, and any other
 site you can think of accessable by normal browsers. the deepweb is 
comprised of possible closed shell systems(CSS) and proxy servers. Some 
of the greater known deepwebs would be like tor, I2P, freenet, but there
 are a few conspiracies floating around theres more. This post will help
 clarify everything. It contains all that i've learned from others, 
specifically coin_pro/J1337 and xynon (macs).<br><br>
		so let me explain the origin of the marianas web, where it all 
started. if you check google trends apparently th first time anyone 
really searched marianas web was 2005. this makes sense because tor was 
created in 2004. It may have dated back further. I'm not entirely sure. 
It seems to ultimately spike at around 2012. and this seems to be the 
birth of marianas web

 read through the post if youre really so interested. from this V3RDAD 
birthed his little dark fantasy network game. I call it a game because 
HIS network is retarded. the nodes he presents are either fake or full 
of feds. He most likely created the lore around it simply out of 
boredom. the first few nodes were the loky, dafy, and clos sites.
		I personally believe the clos sites are real genuine sites that are 
just someones personal network they use. I think <a href="http://honmnaapxzpk2rg7.onion/www/blogs/files/clossys6.3.2.exe">clossys</a>
 is used to access clos, but im not sure. don't run this EXE without a 
good antivirus, I haven't done much disassembly on it yet. As the years 
went on V3RDAD talked about more and more nodes. I have a bunch of links
 in my linklist if youre really interested in what all those nodes are. 
he offered limited access to his network specifically the taur node. he 
offered this software:<br>
		</p><ol>
			<a href="http://honmnaapxzpk2rg7.onion/blogs/www/blogs/files/prepare.sh">prepare.sh</a><br>
			<a href="http://honmnaapxzpk2rg7.onion/blogs/www/blogs/files/taur_node">taur_node</a><br>
			<a href="http://honmnaapxzpk2rg7.onion/blogs/www/blogs/files/node_dbs.dll">node_dbs</a><br>
			<a href="http://honmnaapxzpk2rg7.onion/blogs/www/blogs/files/dafy_node.exe">dafy_node.exe</a>
		</ol><br>
		Don't run these, theyre like RATs. they start a listener on your 
device and connect to some external source. so essentially he proved 
himself to be a phony RATing skid piece of shit. unless he's being 
honest and its connecting to the actual node, but probably not.
		V3RDAD also talked about needing chaosVPN to access his sites. which 
doesn't really work. although Ive seen in one of his askFM posts, he 
said chaosVPN was history. He either uses deepVPN or darkVPN. let me 
give you a rundown on what V3RDAD is like. Hes a nice little brazillian 
dude who has actuall autism, no joke. He claims he worked for cicada 
3301, and says hes a very important person. I doubt that. Hes alot like 
adacic. another man who goes by the alias of N3URO claims that his 
networks are FBU honeypots. He also says that hes never had access 
either, so this might just be an assumption.<br><br>
		<b>UPDATE JANUARY 29TH 2018</b><br>
		after a nice chat with N3URO things have been cleared up, and I 
finnaly have the answer everyone has been waiting for! heres my 
interveiw<br>
		"yeah, non of that bs existed man. V3RDAD and NBK39/4E424B3339 set it all up, put me through mental fucking torture"<br>

		A:well, you see NBK is very smart and a very talented hacker<br><br>

apparently are like computer gods, crafting 0days, and making tools. 
they never talk much.
