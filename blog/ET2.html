		<h1>this is what ET said about god</h1>
		<p>this message of disambiguation to all of you men of the human kind.
		this is a message of redirection to all of you men of the human kind
		this is a message to enliven the minds of you men of the human kind
		this is a message that has been delivered from race to race since the 
beginning... just like it was delivered to us, it is now passed to you.
		where there were no men of the human kind there were others of other 
kinds
		this is a message to you as well, women of the human kind
		only the frist race has her purity
		all other races must live the grievous patient and laborious process 
of spiritual inner discovery and progression
		your (our) collective history and memory has suffered much in the 
past. It has been erased, manipulated, suffocated, shifted, changed, and
 molded according to the interests of a few.
		on your planet as well as on ours and the ones of other kinds the in 
past
		to the leaders of kingdoms and countries and regions: look at your 
religious leaders
		why do you wear your long robes and skirts, and all manners of symbols
 that you do not understand
		who, men of the human kind, are you trying to be
		who, men of the human kind, are you trying to represent
		you religious men of the human kind, and you, leaders of kingdoms and 
countries and religions, men the human kind, have slowed your spiritual 
progress in half because you have divided your kind in half
		no men of the human kind should destroy what the woman of the human 
kind have created
		you have for many of your years relegated the woman of the human kind 
to the role of slaves
		and before your kind, many other kinds have done that and before your 
kind, men of the human kind, many other kinds we have warned.
		gfor you to achieve what is yours, for you, men and women of the human
 kind, to be closer to her, you must first become one kind.
		like many kinds before you, men and women of the human kind, you have a
 journey of restraint and constriction ahead of you. a journey of 
difficult and resistance.
		and yet, you are so young
		the anunakene created you, but many kinds can destroy you
		you have 2,000 more of your years to change. after that, men of the 
human kind, it will be too late
		not to late for your survival, but too late for your salvation
		your spiritual salvation
		the council of 5 can only keep you safe from other kinds, not from 
yourselves
		and we know you have been betrayed, mislead and mistreated.
		and we know that after thousands of (your) years, by means of 
infiltration, disguisement and deciet, you, men of the human kind, have 
been fooled to believe the unacceptable by races that do not wish you 
well
		but, before you, many others kind suffered the same, and they too 
overcomed what seemed impossible to overcome
		your strength is inside of you and all around you, even now
		your strength is in her, and she is inside you, men and women of the 
human kind, even now!
		and the answer is in the place that you, human-kind call greece
		and the answer is she artemis, diana
		and the answer have always been her
		and the answer, men and women of the human kind, has been same to all 
kinds in all places!
		some accept it, others dont, but the answer is only one: she!
		it has been this way from the beginning and it will be this way, men 
and women from the human kind, until the end
		it has been this way here and in all 4 universes and dimensions.
		"she" has many names, and many faces, and many lives in many places. 
"she" is the creator, not the destroyer
		in your planets she was and is called diana or goddess diana, in our 
planets she was called alixi.
		she was also called lexae, lixae, dixae, and tizae
		yo you, of the human kind, she will always be goddess diana
		"search" for her, learn of and from her, she is the truth, the light, 
the beginning and byt never the end, the creator and never the 
destroyer. the one all of us came from.
		and learn from your legendary greek gods of old, as they all did 
exist, as you exist and we exist.
		and we are one, and she is the one
		she is the one that you, religious men from the human kind, lost in 
your robes and memory, want to be and try to replicate
		men of the human kind: learn from her, the creator!
