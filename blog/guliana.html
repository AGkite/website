		<h1>Guliana city location</h1>
		<p>Guliana city, not to be confused with Guiliana CIty, is a hidden 
city located somewhere between malaysia and the indian ocean. The small 
city was built on an island back in the early 1900s  during World War 1.
 Used as a safe haven of sorts. the only people left in the city are 
direct decedents of those that took refuge back in 1914-1918.<br><br>
		Despite the small amount of people rumored to still reside in the 
hidden city. what onc was an extravagant island of sorts is now nothing 
but ruins. The local residents manage to live off the economy provided 
by the island. Some believe Guliana is nothing but a destroyed and 
dangerous city better left alone.</p><br><br>
