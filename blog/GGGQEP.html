		<h1>GGGQEP</h1>
		<p>a form of theoretical storage method uses gadolinium galium garnet.
 it is a manufactured diamond synthetic, it derrives from gadolinium 
galium oxide. These are transparant crstalline solids
		with a high hardness and density.  with 3 powerful lasers you burn out
 a point within the crystal, and with a scanner you read from it.  you 
can only read and write however, you cant rewrite or delete data.

		1 Mol = 872.9118 grams of crystal at a density of 7.08g/cm yields appoximately 123.29cm^3<br>
		cubic root of 123.29cm^3 = 4.977095<br>
		A 5cm x 5cm x 5cm cube... that works out JUST fine<br>.

		This shows that roughly 12.5% or 1/8 of the molecules can be stored as
 bits. 7.52E+022 bits to exabytes = 8153.20034 exabytes exabyte = 1 
billion gigabytes<br>
		This is equal to saving 192 million copies of every book every written
 or about 16 Internets. Google processes 8 exabytes of data every year.<br>
		As of March 2010, the global monthly Internet traffic is estimated to 
be 21 exabytes. As of May 2009, the size of the World's total Digital 
content has been roughly estimated to be 500 billion gigabytes, or 500 
exabytes.<br>
		According to an IDC paper sponsored by EMC Corporation, 161 exabytes 
of data were created in 2006, "3 million times the amount of information
 contained in all the books ever written," with the number expected to 
hit 988 exabytes in 2010.<br>
		According to CSIRO, in the next decade, astronomers expect to be 
processing 10 petabytes of data every hour from the Square Kilometre 
Array (SKA) telescope. The array is thus expected to generate 
approximately one exabyte every four days of operation. According to 
IBM, 
		the new SKA telescope initiative will generate over an exabyte of data
 every day. IBM is designing hardware to process this information.<br>
		ccording to the June 2009 update of the Cisco Visual Networking Index 
IP traffic forecast, by 2013, annual global IP traffic will reach 
two-thirds of a zettabyte or 667 exabytes. Internet video will generate 
over 18 exabytes per month in 2013. 
		Global mobile data traffic will grow at a CAGR of 131 percent between 
2008 and 2013, reaching over two exabytes per month by 2013.<br>
		According to the Digital Britain Report 494 Exabytes of data was transferred across the globe on 15 June 2009.<br>
		According to an IDC paper sponsored by EMC Corporation, 161 exabytes 
of data were created in 2006, "3 million times the amount of information
 contained in all the books ever written," 
		with the number expected to hit 988 exabytes in 2010.<br>
		Several filesystems use disk formats which support theoretical volume 
sizes of several exabytes, including Btrfs, XFS, ZFS, exFAT and NTFS.<br>
		The ext4 file system format supports volumes up to 1 exabyte in size, 
although the userspace tools cannot yet administer such filesystems.<br>
		One exabyte is the equivalent of about 50,000 years of DVD quality video.<br>
		This same principal can be applied to glass, though it would take far more precise equipment.<br>
