			<h1>the 7 principles</h1>
			<p>the 7 principles of hermeticism discussed in the kybalion are very important and is something I believe everyone should learn.<br><br>
			<b>law 1, the law of mentalism</b><br>
			this law states that the all is made up of the mind and mentalism, 
and the all is infinite. therefore the mind is infinite as well<br>
			<b>law 2, the law of corraspondance</b><br>
			"all is below as all is above" - the kybalion<br>
			<b>law 3, the law of vibration</b><br>
			this law states that everything is light, everything is energy. nothing is at rest, and eveything is constantly moving<br>
			<b>law 4, the princible of polarity</b><br>
			everything is dual, everything has poles, and everything has an opposite<br>
			<b>law 5, the law of rhythm</b><br>
			everything flows, in and out. everything has its tides<br>
			<b>law 6, the law of cause and effect</b><br>
			every cause has an effect, every effect has its cause<br>
			<b>law 7, the law of gender</b><br>
			everything has its masculinity, and feminine like principbles<br><br>
			</p><h3>mental transmutation</h3>
			the mind as well as elements may be transmutated. from state to 
state, degree to degree, condition to condition. "all is mental" - the 
kybalion initiates and others of lesser degree than the masters
			are able to work freely alongside the masters within the astral 
planes and spirit realm. <br><br>
			<b>understanding the all</b><br>
			"the all is that which is fundemental truth-- the substantial reality
 is beyond true nameing but the wise men call it the all" - the kybalion
 
			in its essence the all is unknowable. the all is all that really is. 
 nothing can exist outside of the all or else it wouldnt be the all the 
all must be infinite
			and infinite in time as well. it must be eternal. the all is 
imutable. the all is the spirit, well then what is the spirit? that can 
not be answered, because its reasoning and definition is that of the all<br><br>
			<b>the twelve torments</b><br>
			the twelve torments are as follows:<br>
			1. ignorance<br>
			2. sorrow<br>
			3. intemperance<br>
			4. concupiscience<br>
			5. injustice<br>
			6. covetousness<br>
			7. deceit<br>
			8. envy<br>
			9. fraud and guile<br>
			10. wrath<br>
			11. rashness<br>
			12. maliciousness<br>
			these are the 12 torments and from them are born many more.
