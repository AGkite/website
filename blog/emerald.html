		<h1>the emerald table of hermes</h1>
		<p>True, without error, certain and most true: that which is above is 
as that which is below and that which is below is as that which is 
above, to perform the miracles of the one thing.<br>
		And as all things were from one, by the meditation of one, so from 
this one thing come all things by adaptations. Its father is the sun, 
its mother is the moon, the wind carried it in its belly, the nurse 
thereof is Earth<br>
		it is the father of all perfection and the consummation of the whole world. its power is integral if it be turned to earth<br>
		thou shalt seperate the Earth from the fire, the sublt from the 
coarse, gently and with much ingenuity. It ascends from Earth to heaven 
and descends again to Earth, and recieves the power of the superiors and
 the inferiors.<br>
		thus thou hast the glory of the whole world; therefor let all 
obscurity flee before thee. this is the strong fortitude of all 
fortitude, overcoming every sublt and penetrating every solid thing. 
Thus the world was created. Hence are all wonderful adaptations, of 
which this is the manner<br>
		there am I called Hermes the Thrice Great, having the three parts of 
the philosophy of the whole world. That is finished which I have to say 
concerning the operation of the sun</p>
