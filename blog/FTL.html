        <h1>Faster Than Light Travel</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Faster than light travel may seem impossible now thanks to 
eintein and his equations such as E=MC^2, but contrary to popular belief
 it is indeed very possible. There are a few methods of traveling faster
 than the speed of light actually. In this post I hope to make those 
possibilities and theorys seem more like a reality to you.
        </p><h3>alcubierre drive</h3>
        This device was theorized by a man named miguel alcubierre. the 
craft would be possible by creating an energy density field lower than 
that of a vacuum. so basically you need negative mass. Rather than 
exceeding the speed of light within a relative frame of reference, it 
would work by contracting space in front of it, and expanding the space 
behind it. This warp drive is also consistent with Einsteins field 
equations. It might be meaningless though. It requires an exotic matter 
with negative energy density. It is argued by alcubierre that the 
casimir vacuum could fullfill the negative energy requirement.
        <h3>Tachyons</h3>
        Tachyons are a theoretical particle that achieve superluminal travel.
