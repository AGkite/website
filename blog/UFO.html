		<h1>UFOs what are they?</h1>
		<p>first off what is a UFO? a ufo is a <b>unidentified flying object</b> these flying objects are usually disc shaped or similar to the TR-3B aircraft created by the United States military.
		lets start off with the disc type UFOs<br><br>
		the disc shaped ufos typically come from the zeta reticuli which is 
the home star system from the greys which are the typical looking aliens
 with big grey heads and big black eyes.<br>
		<br>
		these discs are powered by a cyclotron bombarding element 115 with 
protons. when protons fuse with 115 it becomes element 116 but it 
immediately decays back into element 115
		when it decays it releases 2 antiprotons this generates energy because
 when antimatter collides with normal matter it exerts energy<br><br>
		
		the method of propulsion is kind of interesting because it taps into a
 gravity wave that we will call gravity A. the gravity A wave is 
amplified and propogated in a lensed method from each of the 3 gravity 
amplifiers
		the amplifiers pulse sequentialy at a counter clockwise motion at a 
rate of about 7.46Hz<br><br>
		
		one configuration known as omicron configuration is used when flying 
near planets. this is possible by lensing the gravity A wave towards by 
the B wave propogated outward from the planet
		changing pitch of the gravity A wave determines lift or attraction. in
 omicron mode only 1 amplifier is needed to hover. howver you need a 
second one to actually move.<br><br>
		
		another interesting thing is maximum distortion. in this state the 
gravit A wave propogated outward from the craft enshrouds the craft is a
 sort of gravity bubble. in this state the craft is nearly invisable
		since the light behind the craft bends around the gravity bubble. once
 the craft achieves maximum distortion, the metal of the craft becomes 
invisable aswell making a sort of windsheild. There is
		also writing on the craft that is not seen anywhere on this planet.
		
		Another configuration known as delta configuration. Delta 
configuration is achieved by focusing the amplified gravity A wave 
toward a distant point in space time. the crafts reactor is a capable of
 
		amplifying the strong nuclear force of the gravity A wave emanating 
from the element 115, and capable of bending space-time and pulling it 
towards the intersection of the craft. the ctaft then 
		makes a small jump to the now near space time and shuts the amplifiers
 off. <br>
		so far this is all that is known about the disc like crafts from zeta reticuli. all information was taken from bob lazar<br><br><br>
		</p><h4>black manta</h4>
		the black manta is large triangular craft that is proppeled using a 
mercury plasma field engine. there is one large engine mounted at the 
center of the craft and 3 smaller one at each corner of the craft
		the entire craft is made of carbon fibre with an alluminum super 
structure. this is required in order to avoid magnetic interference with
 the engine produces toirson fields.  the crew is placed at the 
		center of the craft. here they are within the torsion field so G 
forces dont affect them.<br><br>
		
		the black manta is powered by RTG nuclear batteries. about 200 
batteries total are used to power all the ships computer systems and 
such.<br><br>
		
		the black manta uses steam powered thrusters at all 3 corners of the 
ship for orientation in space. the thrusters are powered by a heated 
compression chamber that channels to the thrusters.
		the forward travel is created when a combination of power levels are 
applied to the torus drive engines. the only limiting speed factor in 
the atmosphere is the heat on the outer skin. the engines
		could push the craft to destruction by causing it to burn up. once in 
higher altitudes of 100,000 feet and up, it can accelerate past mach 9.
		Computer controlled rotation of mercury ferro liquids and field 
patters . the upper torus moves up or down changing the focus of the 
magnetic field porpulsion
