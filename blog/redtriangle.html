        <h1>A puzzle well lasted</h1>
        <p>The red triangle lived a long life, however it needed to come to an end unfortunately after the destruction of Docs server thanks to Howtoarg and those guys.<br>
        for those unaware as to what this puzzle is, it was a puzzle created by zyu, cammy, and ciph3r. These three crypto puzzle creators created a puzzle based around the 9 circles of hell and dantes inferno. It was very dark and described as "serial killer like." people were very attracted to, or repelled from this puzzle.
        at first it began with very simple problems and solutions, with very simple ciphers, but it advanced to challenging puzzles and into dantes 9 circles of hell.
