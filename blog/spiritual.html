        <h3>meditation</h3>
        <p>meditation is probably the best place to start you endeavor unto the esoteric journey in becoming a perfect man. It is the first step taken to ascend into godhood.<br>
        to begin your journey first enter a relaxing setting, then start by breathing you in and out, repeat this until you enter a state of relaxation unlike any other. think of nothing. if anything enters your mind dont focus on it, only focus on your breathing, and how you feel. you'll begin to drift in and out of consciousness. time will begin to be irrelevant. try increasing the amount of time you meditate every day. also, meditating daily is VERY important.<br><br>
        When you're ready for this, begin to excercise your powers. Start by visualizing a circle, then a triangle around this circle, and then a square around the triangle.<br>
        meditation is very important because it helps you control yourself, it helps relax and keep the mind at ease. you can use this to focus on your life, and get over tough obstacles. It is truly an amzing thing.<br>
        once you are able to meditate for at least 20 minutes, and you've masted the imaging technique of visualizing the shapes. move on to the next step.
        <h3>using meditation to heal the chakras.</h3>
        First let me establish what exactly the chakras are, where they are located, and what colors are associated with which chakra.<br>
        first there is the crown chakra at the top of the head. its color is indigo, and it functions as wisdom, and transcendence.<br>
        the next chakra is the third eye chakra. its color is blue, and its functionality is extrasensory perception, and intuition<br>
        the third chakra is the throat chakra located obviously at the throat. it is a light blue color, and functions as personal truth.<br>
        the fourth chakra is the heart chakra. It is emerald green and functions as love and compassion.<br>
        the fifth chakra is the solar plexus chakra. It is yellow in color, and functions as the will.<br>
        the sixth chakra is the sacral chakra, and is orange in color. It functions as the emotion and creativity.<br>
        the seventh and last chakra is the root chakra. It is red in color, and functions as the will to live.<br><br>
        
        there is a plethora of information on chakras here at this website:<br>
        http://www.chakras.info/<br>
        if you think you are ready to move on then please do. Don't push yourself though, these arent physical excersizess.<br><br>
        
        <h3>astral projection</h3>
        the astral plane is fairly complex, it is the next step above the material plane, or the plane of existence we're on now. here you'll see a variety of things, such as ghosts, demons, good and evil, etc. 
        "black, and, white are, all I see"<br>
        people describe what its like to astral project, and they say its more mental than physical. you will know youre projecting because you will be able to get up and see your body resting where you originally sat down at. theres no need to worry about getting lost, there is always a rope attactched between you and your material body.<br>
        you can have astral sex, though its addicting so dont do it often and only do it with people you entirely trust. Otherwise you'll be subject to vaperism.<br>
        Im not sure if you can die in the astral plane or not, so don't risk it.<br><br>
