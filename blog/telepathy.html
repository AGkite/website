		<h1>telepathy, what is it?</h1>
		<p><b>telepathy</b> is the ability to tune into your consciousness and
 any other background information coming to you in the form of thought. 
Telepathy is a skill just like carpentry or playing instruments. The 
more you practice, the better you'll be at hearing the "unknown". To 
actually use telepathy, you need to exit the beta state of your mind, 
and enter the alpha state. the beta state is your normal awake state, 
you can enter the alpha state when day dreaming, or doing repititive 
tasks. You can also enter the alpha state when making art, or coloring 
something like a mandala. I enter the alpha state by meditating. Once 
you are in this state, you may hallucinate, or hear things that makes 
you look around you, or ask "did you hear that?" when doing this try to 
distance yourself from electronics, even the electricity running through
 your home can effect your mind. all in all, just pay attention to the 
things in the back of your mind, observe your thoughts.
