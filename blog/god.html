		<h1>our purpose here</h1>
		<p>our purpuse here is to spread peace, love, and to learn, these 
words were taken directly from many different near death experiences, 
and while meditating i've heard it from spirits. This might seem 
pointless, I know a lot of people who think love is stupid and just some
 chemical reaction in their brain, but I can explain why it's an amazing
 thing. Once you experience true love for everything, its euphoric, its 
like you can see more clearly, and see things in a brighter way. I 
remember after I started changing the way I live to love everything, and
 learn, and teach the things I learn, I could see minor, and small 
details that i've never noticed before. I also feel waaay happier, and 
am no longer depressed. the reason we are supposed to spread love, and 
learn is also because it betters the collective spirit itself, the more 
you learn, the more intelligent out collective spirit it.<br><br>
		</p><h1>when we die</h1>
		when we die we first exit our body, you won't even feel it. you just 
float up a bit and see yourself, lying there, hopefully peacefully in 
your bed. you will see yourself and you will be very calm, then you will
 start to float upward absorbing our of the universe into the next. you 
will see a light, the light will come to you, and get bigger and bigger,
 and engulf you in beauty and love. after this you will meet someone 
like your spirit guide or God whoever you decide is best. you will see 
your life all around you in a 360 degree view. you will relive it all 
simultaneously, but all the bad things you thought would send you to 
"hell" you will see and both you, and your spirit guide will just laugh 
at it, like laughing at a child making a mistake. when this is over, you
 will probably have some qeustions, but do not worry, these spirits will
 answer you. I also forgot to mention, there is no time, everything is 
always. after youre done going over your qeustions, and viewing your 
life, I believe you get the option to go back, or stay there in the 
spirit realm. from my understanding a lot of people choose to go back, 
because they enjoy their life. they enjoy learning. Our lives are like 
classes, and lessons. it is like school. choose to learn and you will 
learn, choose to slack off and steal, and kill, you will learn nothing. 
I'm assuming if you didn't learn anything then you are forced to go back
 and learn something.
		<h1>is there heaven, and is there hell?</h1>
		Not what you think. Heaven and Hell are both mindsets. if you are 
evil, you will have an evil afterlife, if you are good and happy, you 
will have a good and happy after life, everything is your 
responsibility. choose your path. you can enter heaven through 
completing your lessson of learning, and spreadying love, and being 
happy. you can enter hell by stealing, killing, and causing sorrow. I 
believe the whole point of living is to actually bring the mindset of 
heaven to Earth so everyone can live peacefully among each other. this 
is actually what the illuminati is trying to achieve. the "new world 
order" with a one world government would be some what beneficial because
 we would all eventually work it out and live amongst everyone and each 
other happily some time down the line. It is also the first step in 
public alien contact. we'd also need to decrease the population, and 
theres no better way of doing that other than a World War 3. It's sad to
 think about, but if you are innocent and you die in the process, at 
least you'll be happily amongst the sea of consciousness.<br>
		<h1>accessing the spirit realm "alive"</h1>
		you can of course see the spirit realm and access it here on Earth as 
well! close your eyes, what do you see? if your answer was darkness you 
were wrong, you need to look closer and deeper, keep going deeper and 
deeper until you see it. It's there trust me, I see it when I close my 
eyes, I feel it when I breathe, I hear it when there's silence. once you
 see it, you've achieved meditation. all the answers are found within 
you whilst meditating didn't you know that? there's nothing to look for 
outside yourself except for experience, and knowledge of what there is 
to be. eventually you'll see the "eye" which looks like a big circle in 
the middle of your head, you'll feel its presence, you'll feel it 
looking in you. Don't be afraid of it, it's you. then you will see the 
splash of moving blues and purples swirling around. this I believe is 
your consciousness. You can ask it qeustions if you feel like you're 
ready for the answers, you might feel like you haven't gotten a 
response. this is because the answers sound like and feel like your own 
thoughts. This is because they are! they are yourself, you're higher 
self.
