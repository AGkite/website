		So if youre into this weird lore of the deepweb, and the mysteries 
that surround it, i'm sure youre aware of the Polymeric falcighol 
derivation. This is represented by this c=λ/2(1-λ/2) equation. this is 
pretty stupid, and its really just lore. It's like the big vatican 
secret archive of the internet. Don't waste your time over this stuff, 
instead researching things more interesting and realistic like the D 
wave systems<br><br>
		the D wave computer is so advanced only people proficient in advanced 
mathematics or quantum mechanics can really work on it. even still they 
aren't practical for real world use. however, there are some helpful 
tools to help us "common folk" out with quantum computers, and quantum 
programming. for example D wave systems has come up with a nice 
programming tool called <a href="https://github.com/dwavesystems/qbsolv">qbsolv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lanl/qmasm">qmasm</a> which helps with the programming for D wave. these tools hopefully can help it less complex.<br><br>
		So, you might be asking yourself, how do these strange machines work? 
well a plebian might say "magic", but we all know thats complete and 
utter nonsense. These D-Wave machines word through a process called 
quantum annealing. this science paper explains in thorough detail what 
that is https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02206. One simple, and kind of stupid
 challenge we've ran into though with this. There is an over abundance 
of wiring required for this process to work. for example, 16 magnets 
would require 120 magnets. Now imagine a 2000 qubit quantum computer. 
they also consume quite a bit of energy. Heres a white paper explaining 
that 
http://www.dwavesys.com/sites/default/files/14-1005A_D_wp_Computational_Power_Consumption_and_Speedup.pdf.
 The power consumption has grown more effiecient though.

		So. qubits, you might've heard about them. If you don't know what they
 are then heres an explanation. so normal bits of information can be 
either 0 or 1, they can never be both or somewhere in between. A quantum
 bit or qubit(sometimes qbit) can both a 0 and 1, or inbetween. this is 
because of superposition. this is achieved with only one qubit. With two
 qubits you can achieve quantum entanglement.
