		<h1>crystalline power metrics</h1>
		<p>as most crystallines solids carry an electric charge the egyptians 
found a way to remove electricity from any electrolytes and quartz in 
about 1300 B.C.E unfortunately though this technology
		never spread to Europe though because they were the last nomadic group
 and were mostly considered barbaric. the egyptians got the quartz to 
weild 12 amps. there are depictions of the egyptians 
		using hand held lights in a couple of their paintings. today you can 
still use this quartz technology but it is a lot more weaker than it has
 been for somer reason. this is an unsolved mystery no one
		can explain. an example of crystalline power metrics would be the 
baghdad battery
